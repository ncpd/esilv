# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Projects
### Decision Tree
The ***Decision Tree*** folder contains my decision tree made in C with Codeblocks. The ***Decision Tree LaTeX*** folder is my report about what I did
and everything I developed in this application.
### Release
If you want to download the release I did for the Decision Tree, you can click [here](https://github.com/nickxla/StructuresAlgo/blob/master/Release/release.zip) then download the release.zip, containing the exe and the txt file with iris data.  
**:x: NB :** The release.exe won't work if the iris.txt file isn't in the same location !
### TDs
Every tdx-algo folder is directed work we did in class to learn data structures and algorithms, with x being the td number.
